## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables which will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
- The data was given in a CSV format

## Conclusions
- We have created a model using ridge regression to predict price of houses. 
- The features that very important for  the prediction are found to be 
    - GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet 
    - OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house 
    - PropAge: Age of the property
